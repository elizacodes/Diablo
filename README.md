# Diablo

## üóíÔ∏è Description
This project has been inspired by Blizzard/Battle.net's Diablo IV game.

This program allows a fellow Diablo fan to enter the data of their following characters. Then, the following information will be added to an Excel file that will be imported into the program. This file contains the same following data amongst multiple characters that were created based on different characters from Diablo IV. The user will be allowed to enter as many characters as they wish based upon their gameplay and each character will continuously be added to the following data.

The following information that the user will have to provide are:
- Name
- Gender
- Class
- Character Level

The purpose of this program is to allow the user to have their character added to the data of other players and see the data analysis provided amongst other characters. For example, if the user would like to see the analysis of who is on the same world tier as the player, then the application will be able to update that information in data visualization format. Additionally, the developer's intent of this project is to develop a Python program that allows the user to continuously put in data and allow the data to update via hosted on a web application written in Python. Exploratory data analysis will be provided on the web application.
